# Amazon Project
## Basic Java Project 

Create a project based on basic-project named amazon-project. You will be creating an amazon test similar to the test we created for ebay-project. You will want to use Selenium IDE to record a test with amazon. The process for the test should be to login (requires you to register first so you can have credentials), search for an item, add the item to your cart, and validate that the current quantity is in the cart (using an assert), complete the test by clearing your shopping cart and logging out.
